What is still wrong:

- [ ] HTTP status codes: method validation and error handling
- [ ] path resolution: Non-existent paths should return 404, not redirect
- [ ] method restrictions: Check configuration and return 405/403 for restricted methods
- [ ] CGI POST handling: Ensure POST data reaches CGI scripts
- [ ] body size limits: Check request body size against configuration
- [ ] Setup multiple servers: Configure and bind to multiple ports
